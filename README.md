For this challenge we need to edit the html so that it is utilizing semantic tags instead of non-semantic tags.

Changes Made:
   -I changed the first div tag with a header tag
   -I then changed all the other div tags within the header to section tags.
   -In the CSS file I changed the header div tags to header section tags so it would match the HTML and read the CSS properly.
   -I changed the div tag before class="content" to a nav tag
   -I then changed all the div tags within that section to article tags.
   -I changed the div tag in front of class="benefits" to a section tag.
   -I then changed all the div tags div tags within that section to aside tags.
   -Lastly, I changed the div tag at the very end to a footer tag.
